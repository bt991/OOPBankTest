# OOPBankTest

This program was created as a final project for CSI405 (Object Oriented Programming). The objective was to showcase a handful of OOP principles and concepts within the code itself. Types shown within this code include: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Composition, Generics, Adapter pattern.

The model of the code was to create a transaction sysem for a bank, including branches for specified banks, tellers, accounts types, and people who would then use the banks. The code would log transaction data as well as be able to store personal information about the bank users and their accounts.
